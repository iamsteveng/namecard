### Session 12 (August 10, 2025)
- **Frontend Docker Container Implementation (COMPLETE)**:
  - Created production-ready multi-stage Dockerfile (Node.js build â†’ Nginx serving)

  - Optimized static asset caching with gzip compression and proper cache headers
  - Successfully built and tested: 332.88 kB JavaScript, 28.27 kB CSS bundles
- **CORS Configuration Fix (COMPLETE)**:
  - **Root Cause**: API server only allowed requests from `http://localhost:5173` but Docker frontend runs on `http://localhost:8080`
  - **Solution**: Enhanced CORS configuration to support multiple origins with comma-separated values
  - **Implementation**: Updated `env.ts` to parse multiple origins into array, fixed TypeScript typing
  - **Testing**: Verified preflight requests now return correct `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` headers
- **Full Stack Docker Integration (COMPLETE)**:
  - Updated docker-compose.yml to include frontend service with proper dependencies
  - Added npm scripts for easy development: `frontend:up`, `fullstack:test`, `fullstack:logs`
  - Validated complete containerized environment: PostgreSQL + Redis + API + Frontend
  - All services healthy and operational with proper health checks and networking
- **Production-Ready Environment**:
  - **Frontend**: http://localhost:8080 (Nginx + React SPA)
  - **API**: http://localhost:3001/health (Express + TypeScript + Authentication)
  - **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM, Redis caching
  - **CORS**: Multi-origin support for development workflows
- **Files Created**: `packages/web/Dockerfile`, `packages/web/nginx.conf`, `packages/web/docker-entrypoint.sh`, `packages/web/.dockerignore`

  - **Solution**: Implemented container-based automated migration system using ECS tasks
  - **Local Testing**: Successfully verified migration process with Docker containers
  - **Production Migration**: ECS task migration completed successfully (Exit code: 0, 373ms execution)
