   - Add file upload component with drag-and-drop functionality
   - Implement image preview with cropping and rotation capabilities
   - Add real-time validation feedback for image quality

2. **Frontend Integration**:
   - Connect to existing `/api/v1/cards/scan` endpoint 
   - Implement progress indicators for upload and processing stages
   - Add success/error handling with user-friendly messages
   - Create loading states and progress tracking during OCR processing

3. **Card Results Display**:
   - Build CardResultsComponent to display extracted data
