## Next Development Session Notes

### Task 18: Implement Card Data Extraction and Processing Pipeline
**Objective**: Create a complete pipeline that takes uploaded images, processes them through OCR, and saves structured business card data to the database

**Planned Implementation:**
1. **Card Creation Workflow**:
   - Integrate upload â†’ OCR â†’ database save pipeline
   - Create API endpoint: `POST /api/v1/cards/scan-and-save`
   - Handle image upload, OCR processing, and card record creation in one workflow

2. **Database Integration**:
   - Save extracted business card data to cards table
   - Associate cards with authenticated users
   - Store image references and OCR metadata
   - Implement card validation and manual editing capabilities

3. **Enhanced Data Processing**:
   - Improve business card field extraction accuracy
   - Add confidence scoring for individual fields
   - Implement data normalization (phone numbers, emails, addresses)
   - Add duplicate detection and merging logic

4. **API Enhancements**:
   - Create card management endpoints (CRUD operations)
   - Add search and filtering capabilities
   - Implement card sharing and export features
   - Add batch processing for multiple business cards

### Technical Decisions Made
- **React Router**: Chose React Router DOM over Tanstack Router for simplicity
- **State Management**: React Query for server state, Zustand for client state
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with mobile-first responsive design
- **Icons**: Lucide React for consistent iconography
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled across all packages

### Important Notes for Continuity
- All packages use consistent ESLint + Prettier configuration
